# chess-game

Create a website that is hosted on github, turning the chess game that my team created into a freely accessible and fully online chess game

      1.a -"Create the website itself"
      
      1.b -"Build a website interface in html+javascript that would be /visually/ based on our game's current UI but not reusing any code because I can barely read python"
      
      1.c -Get my website to reference the non-UI portion of the game that's stored in a different github repository already
      
      1.d -Make sure that all of this is accessible and applicable to different browsers, screen sizes, etc, and is fully playable from only a link"
Revise to allow two humans to play each other remotely

To be able to play synchronously

AND To be able to play off-line, time-irrelevant (a game could be continued over days and weeks without the app remaining live the entire time.)

Document the communication and game save mechanism and plan, and how asynchronous play will be supported.
